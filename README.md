# 1st things 1st

Shout out to **Taiseer Joudeh** on his great article "[# Secure ASP.NET Web API using API Key Authentication â€“ HMAC Authentication](http://bitoftech.net/2014/12/15/secure-asp-net-web-api-using-api-key-authentication-hmac-authentication/)", that inspired me to publish this little project.


# Projects

[Security.HMACAuthentication](https://github.com/12CodeMonkeys/Security.HMACAuthentication/tree/master/Security.HMACAuthentication "Security.HMACAuthentication") is the glue that brings the server side Security.HMACAuthentication.Attribute library and the client side Security.HMACAuthentication.DelegatingHandlers together, ensuring that both sides process request identically.
